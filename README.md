1.Number of Vaccinations

    We have a report on the number of flu vaccinations in a class of
    20 people.

    It has the following numbers:
    never: 5
    once: 8
    twice: 4
    3 times: 3

    What is the mean number of times those people have been vaccinated?
    Output the result using the print() statement.

2.Number of Vaccinations 2nd

    Using the same vaccinations dataset, which includes the number of times people got the flu vaccine.
    The dataset contains the following numbers:
    never: 5
    once: 8
    twice: 4
    3 times: 3

    Calculate and output the variance.
    Declare a list with the data and use a loop to calculate the value.
    We will soon learn about easier ways to calculate the variance 
    and other summary statistics using Python. 
    For now, use Python code to calculate the result using the corresponding equation.

3.Square Footage

You are given an array that holds the square footage data for houses on a particular street.
A new house has just been constructed on that street.

    Modify your program to take the new house value as 
    input, add it to the array, and output the array 
    sorted in ascending order.

4.Seats in a Theater

You are given an array that represents the occupancy of seats in a movie theater. A seat marked with 1 is occupied, while one marked 0 means the seat is free.
However, the array is flat and 1-dimensional.

    Transform it into a 2-dimensional array, representing the rows of the seats.
    Each row in the theater has 5 seats and there are a total of 30 seats.
    Reshape the array into the corresponding shape and output the row at the given index, which is taken from user input.
