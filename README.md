1.Number of Vaccinations

    We have a report on the number of flu vaccinations in a class of
    20 people.

    It has the following numbers:
    never: 5
    once: 8
    twice: 4
    3 times: 3

    What is the mean number of times those people have been vaccinated?
    Output the result using the print() statement.

2.Number of Vaccinations 2nd

    Using the same vaccinations dataset, which includes the number of times people got the flu vaccine.
    The dataset contains the following numbers:
    never: 5
    once: 8
    twice: 4
    3 times: 3

    Calculate and output the variance.
    Declare a list with the data and use a loop to calculate the value.
    We will soon learn about easier ways to calculate the variance 
    and other summary statistics using Python. 
    For now, use Python code to calculate the result using the corresponding equation.

3.Square Footage

    You are given an array that holds the square footage data for houses on a particular street.
    A new house has just been constructed on that street.
    Modify your program to take the new house value as input, add it to the array, and output the array sorted in ascending order.
